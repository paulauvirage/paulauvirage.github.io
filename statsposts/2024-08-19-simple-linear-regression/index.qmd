### Working example - trophy hunting of lions

Trophy hunting of lions, particularly males, is a controversial, but [active](https://www.discountafricanhunts.com/hunts/hunt-lion-in-tanzania.html#:~:text=Hunt%20Lion%20in%20Tanzania&text=Rifle%20Only%201%20x%201%20Starting%20at%20%2455%2C000!), means of conserving populations. Selective killing of older lions is thought to result in fewer knock-on deaths, as older animals are less likely to be breeding and the killing of a younger breeding male can result in further lion deaths, particularly through infanticide, as a new male replaces the killed male in the pride. The amount of black on a lion's nose is the best remote indicator of age. This measure has been taken from lions in a long term study at the Serengeti, Tanzania. The data is available for re-analysis in the R package `abd` and has been used as an example of linear regression in the online book [Statistics for ecologists](https://statistics4ecologists-v2.netlify.app/linreg) .

## Open data
This worked example is possible because the data has been made easily, publicly accessible. It is not essential, though it is helpful, that it is accessible through an `R` package. In a later post an optimal workflow for scientists will be discussed in which open data is a component.   
Note that there are five types of callouts, including: `note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.

### The objectives of regression

Let's review what regression aims to do.

## The objectives of regression

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.

It is a form of **statistical inference**, generalising from the sample on which measurements have been taken to the population which
