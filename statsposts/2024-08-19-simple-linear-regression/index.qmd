### Document structure

This tutorial assumes that you are working in R Studio.

As with all posts in this group, the main text is interspersed with two types of blocks.

**Call-outs** of supporting information, such as this one, are folded away to avoid their interfering with a first read of the post. I recommend reading them all. You can unfold them by clicking on the far right arrow inside the box.

**Code blocks**, with a grey background and monotype font, are not folded away. They allow you to implement all of the analysis in the post on your computer. You can cut and paste the code in each code block into your own R scripting window in R Studio, by clicking on the clipboard in the right end of the block, but I recommend your typing it in, to get practice in how R code works in R Studio.

### Working example - trophy hunting of lions

Trophy hunting of lions, particularly males, is a controversial, but [active](https://www.discountafricanhunts.com/hunts/hunt-lion-in-tanzania.html#:~:text=Hunt%20Lion%20in%20Tanzania&text=Rifle%20Only%201%20x%201%20Starting%20at%20%2455%2C000!), means of conserving populations. Selective killing of older lions is thought to result in fewer knock-on deaths, as older animals are less likely to be breeding and the killing of a younger breeding male can result in further lion deaths, particularly through infanticide, as a new male replaces the killed male in the pride. The amount of black on a lion's nose is the best remote indicator of age. This measure has been taken for lions of known age in a long term study at the Serengeti, Tanzania. The data is available for re-analysis in the R package `abd` and has been used for an example of linear regression in the online book [Statistics for ecologists](https://statistics4ecologists-v2.netlify.app/linreg) .

## The advantages of open data

This worked example is possible because the data has been made easily, publicly accessible. It is not essential, though it is helpful, that it is accessible through an `R` package. In a later post an optimal workflow for scientists will be discussed in which open data is a component.

### The objectives of regression

Let's review what regression aims to do, applied to the lion nose data, in the call-out box below.

## The objectives of regression

Regression is the most widely used method of **statistical inference**, generalising from the sample on which measurements have been taken to the population for which a hypothesis or, more often and more usefully, the size and direction of effects, is sought.

The sample data for a regression problem, gathered for the project or reused, contains, for each unit on which measurements have been taken, the **outcome** it is hope to explain and one or more **predictors** which it is hoped can explain variability in the outcome.

Regression, and statistical inference more generally, is therefore a problem of prediction in the face of uncertainty. There is uncertainty about whether:

-   the sample represents the population;
-   the measurements are truly measuring the features of interest ("measurement validity"); and
-   the mathematical relation between outcome and predictor is causal.

Regression usually seeks to predict the average outcome for the predictor(s). To be more explicit in applying this reasoning to the lion nose data set, the predictor is the amount of black on the nose and the outcome which it is aimed to predict is the age of a lion for which the predictor (nose black marks) has been measured, but the outcome (age) is not known.

An hypothesis test could establish whether or not there is a relation between measured nose markings and age, usually phrased as a **null hypothesis**; H~0~ there is no relation, versus the **alternative hypothesis** that H~0~ is not supported.

This course will not concern itself much with hypothesis testing, but rather the more useful measurement of effects; is there a predictable change in the amount nose marking with age?

It is very unlikely that every lion of a certain age will have exactly the same amount of nose markings. If this was true, you would not need to use statistics, but rather simple algebra. Variability, arising from whatever processes cause nose markings and/or measurement error, are likely to give a range of values for lions of the same age. A regression model uses this variability and the size of the sample data (number of individuals with both nose marking and age measured) to estimate and report on the uncertainty in any prediction. Depending on the method of inference used - Frequentist or Bayesian - the uncertainty is reported as **confidence intervals** or **credible intervals** which have subtly different meanings. This will be discussed more later. What is important to remember is that statistical modelling, as opposed to deterministic modelling, is: necessary when there is variability in the data; and is reported with measures of uncertainty. *add important uses of regression from Gelman p5?*

### Analysis of the lion nose data with R

#### Step 1. Subject matter questions

When possible choose an important question that is likely to be soluble from the data. The Lion is classified as globally [Vulnerable](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/15951/259030422). Trophy hunting is economically valuable. Therefore an investigation of how selective trophy hunting could minimise the impact on the lion population size is of importance. There is evidence that trophy hunting older lions could cause less impact on the population and that lion age can be measured unobtrusively from the amount of black marking on the nose. The broad questions are:

a.  Is there a difference in nose marking with age (hypothesis test)?
b.  Can the difference be modelled to provide a measure of how nose markings change with age (regression model); and
c.  Can the model be applied, for example to regulate permits for trophy hunting?

#### Step 3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA), jumping Step 2 (Study Design) as existing data is being used.

Let's start with question b. The data is already collected, so the usual **Step 2** of designing a study to collect data is not necessary. The existing data is loaded into R, after importing into the analysis session the necessary R packages for the data handling, manipulation and analysis.

## Package management in R

If you are familiar with software that comes ready packaged with all of its capabilities, R may seem strange. It follows a different philosophy of bundling up one or a few related tasks into a package. When R is first downloaded onto your computer, it comes with 15 "base" packages, of the c21,000 packages available in the cloud on the [Comprehensive R Archive network](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/) and others on other cloud storage locations.

Any analysis usually needs more than the base packages. This course will use an extra 20 or so. You can, with an internet connection, download and install any extra packages onto your computer, where they will be added to your package library (see the packages tab in R Studio's lower right window). As developers work on packages, the changed version needs to be updated on your computer. You will not be prompted to update. In R Studio the packages -\> update tab is available for this. It will, with an internet connection, search for those of your installed packages that have updates and give you the option to install the updated versions. Most packages are less than 1MB in size and few more than 5MB, so I recommend you check and update packages as often as you have a stable internet connection. I have about 100 packages and update (there usually is something to update) daily, but less often is fine.

Once a package is on your computer, it is not yet available to use in your current analysis session. For this you need to import the package from your library, with a line of code using the `library` function; for example `library(marginaleffect)` to import the Marginal Effects package. Repeat this for each package. In writing a script of R code for any work, you usually start with lines to import the necessary packages, as without them the subsequent code depending on them will not run.

#| message: false

lion_noses <- as.data.frame(LionNoses)                    # <1>

ggplot(LionNoses, aes(proportion.black, age)) +           # <2>
  geom_point() +                                          # <3>
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x) +           
  xlab("Proportion of nose black") +                      # <4>
  ylab("Age (years)")                                     # <4>
```

1. Load `LionNoses` from the `abd` package into a data.frame
2. Create a ggplot object with the lion_noses data, with the predictor variable proportion.black on the x axis and age on the y axis
3. Add a scatterplot with `geom_point`
4. Change the x and y axis labels with `xlab` and `ylab`
