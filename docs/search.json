Selective killing of older lions is thought to result in fewer knock-on deaths, as older animals are less likely to be breeding and the killing of a younger breeding male can result in further lion deaths, particularly through infanticide, as a new male replaces the killed male in the pride. The amount of black on a lion’s nose is the best remote indicator of age. This measure has been taken for lions of known age in a long term study at the Serengeti, Tanzania. The data is available for re-analysis in the R package abd and has been used for an example of linear regression in the online book Statistics for ecologists .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe advantages of open data\n\n\n\n\n\nThis worked example is possible because the data has been made easily, publicly accessible. It is not essential, though it is helpful, that it is accessible through an R package. In a later post an optimal workflow for scientists will be discussed in which open data is a component.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe objectives of regression\nLet’s review what regression aims to do, applied to the lion nose data, in the call-out box below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe objectives of regression\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression is the most widely used method of statistical inference, generalising from the sample on which measurements have been taken to the population for which a hypothesis or, more often and more usefully, the size and direction of effects, is sought.\nThe sample data for a regression problem, gathered for the project or reused, contains, for each unit on which measurements have been taken, the outcome it is hope to explain and one or more predictors which it is hoped can explain variability in the outcome.\nRegression, and statistical inference more generally, is therefore a problem of prediction in the face of uncertainty. There is uncertainty about whether:\n\nthe sample represents the population;\nthe measurements are truly measuring the features of interest (“measurement validity”); and\nthe mathematical relation between outcome and predictor is causal.\n\nRegression usually seeks to predict the average outcome for the predictor(s). To be more explicit in applying this reasoning to the lion nose data set, the predictor is the amount of black on the nose and the outcome which it is aimed to predict is the age of a lion for which the predictor (nose black marks) has been measured, but the outcome (age) is not known.\nAn hypothesis test could establish whether or not there is a relation between measured nose markings and age, usually phrased as a null hypothesis; H0 there is no relation, versus the alternative hypothesis that H0 is not supported.\nThis course will not concern itself much with hypothesis testing, but rather the more useful measurement of effects; is there a predictable change in the amount nose marking with age?\nIt is very unlikely that every lion of a certain age will have exactly the same amount of nose markings. If this was true, you would not need to use statistics, but rather simple algebra. Variability, arising from whatever processes cause nose markings and/or measurement error, are likely to give a range of values for lions of the same age. A regression model uses this variability and the size of the sample data (number of individuals with both nose marking and age measured) to estimate and report on the uncertainty in any prediction. Depending on the method of inference used - Frequentist or Bayesian - the uncertainty is reported as confidence intervals or credible intervals which have subtly different meanings. This will be discussed more later. What is important to remember is that statistical modelling, as opposed to deterministic modelling, is: necessary when there is variability in the data; and is reported with measures of uncertainty. add important uses of regression from Gelman p5?\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the lion nose data with R\n\nStep 1. Subject matter questions\nWhen possible choose an important question that is likely to be soluble from the data. The Lion is classified as globally Vulnerable. Trophy hunting is economically valuable. Therefore an investigation of how selective trophy hunting could minimise the impact on the lion population size is of importance. There is evidence that trophy hunting older lions could cause less impact on the population and that lion age can be measured unobtrusively from the amount of black marking on the nose. The broad questions are:\n\nIs there a difference in nose marking with age (hypothesis test)?\nCan the difference be modelled to provide a measure of how nose markings change with age (regression model); and\nCan the model be applied, for example to regulate permits for trophy hunting?\n\n\n\nStep 3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA), jumping Step 2 (Study Design) as existing data is being used.\nLet’s start with question b. The data is already collected, so the usual Step 2 of designing a study to collect data is not necessary. The existing data is loaded into R, after importing into the analysis session the necessary R packages for the data handling, manipulation and analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage management in R\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are familiar with software that comes ready packaged with all of its capabilities, R may seem strange. It follows a different philosophy of bundling up one or a few related tasks into a package. When R is first downloaded onto your computer, it comes with 15 “base” packages, of the c21,000 packages available in the cloud on the Comprehensive R Archive network and others on other cloud storage locations.\nAny analysis usually needs more than the base packages. This course will use an extra 20 or so. You can, with an internet connection, download and install any extra packages onto your computer, where they will be added to your package library (see the packages tab in R Studio’s lower right window). As developers work on packages, the changed version needs to be updated on your computer. You will not be prompted to update. In R Studio the packages -&gt; update tab is available for this. It will, with an internet connection, search for those of your installed packages that have updates and give you the option to install the updated versions. Most packages are less than 1MB in size and few more than 5MB, so I recommend you check and update packages as often as you have a stable internet connection. I have about 100 packages and update (there usually is something to update) daily, but less often is fine.\nOnce a package is on your computer, it is not yet available to use in your current analysis session. For this you need to import the package from your library, with a line of code using the library function; for example library(marginaleffect) to import the Marginal Effects package. Repeat this for each package. In writing a script of R code for any work, you usually start with lines to import the necessary packages, as without them the subsequent code depending on them will not run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImport packages to session\n\nImport packages into current session\n\n# run the function install.packages(\"abd\") or any other name if the package abd or another is not already installed  \n# Run the `library` function each time you need to use the package in a new R session, to make the package available from your library\nlibrary(abd) # a biological data package that includes the lion nose data\nlibrary(tidyverse) # a group of eight packages including ggplot2 for data visualisation \nlibrary(modelsummary)\nlibrary(marginaleffects)\nlibrary(rstanarm) # Bayesian inference\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImport and plot lion nose data\n\nImport and plot lion nose data\n\n1lion_noses &lt;- as.data.frame(LionNoses)\n\n2ggplot(LionNoses, aes(proportion.black, age)) +\n3  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ x) +           \n4  xlab(\"Proportion of nose black\") +\n  ylab(\"Age (years)\")\n\n\n\n\n1\n\nLoad LionNoses from the abd package into a data.frame\n\n2\n\nCreate a ggplot object with the lion_noses data, with the predictor variable proportion.black on the x axis and age on the y axis\n\n3\n\nAdd a scatterplot with geom_point\n\n4\n\nChange the x and y axis labels with xlab and ylab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsam csik’s blog article has instructions and code, how to add footnotes and a bibliography and citations and how to populate margins.
