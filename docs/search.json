    "text": "Working example - trophy hunting of lions\nTrophy hunting of lions, particularly males, is a controversial, but active, means of conserving populations. Selective killing of older lions is thought to result in fewer knock-on deaths, as older animals are less likely to be breeding and the killing of a younger breeding male can result in further lion deaths, particularly through infanticide, as a new male replaces the killed male in the pride. The amount of black on a lion’s nose is the best remote indicator of age. This measure has been taken from lions in a long term study at the Serengeti, Tanzania. The data is available for re-analysis in the R package abd and has been used as an example of linear regression in the online book Statistics for ecologists .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen data\n\n\n\nThis worked example is possible because the data has been made easily, publicly accessible. It is not essential, though it is helpful, that it is accessible through an R package. In a later post an optimal workflow for scientists will be discussed in which open data is a component.\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including: note, warning, important, tip, and caution.\n\n\n\n# install.packages(\"abd\") only if not already installed  \nlibrary(abd) # Each time you want to access the data in a new R session\n\n\n\nThe objectives of regression\nLet’s review what regression aims to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe objectives of regression\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a ‘folded’ caution callout that can be expanded by the user.
